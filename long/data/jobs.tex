    The aim of this post-doc is to enable efficient model checking of temporal properties
    in the context of collective adaptive systems.
    Building upon previous work with the CONVECS team, I developed an automated translation 
    of a state-based temporal property language into MCL (an extension of the
    alternation-free fragment of the modal $\mu$-calculus), and used it to verify 
    a selection of systems.
    I am also investigating how compositional verification techniques may help with
    model checking of large systems.

        The grant topic was ``Verification of Emerging Properties in Collective Adaptive Systems''.
        I adapted a structural encoding procedure I had been working upon as part of my PhD to multiple verification
        tools implementing a variety of techniques, including predicate 
        abstraction, $k$-induction and property-directed reachability.

    As a visitor at CONVECS I focussed on topics related to my thesis,
